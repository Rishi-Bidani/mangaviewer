# MangaViewer

This application allows you to view your downloaded mangas using my custom manga viewer on PC which
allows several features such as changing he image widths, aligning the images to the left, right of centered,
It also allows you the change the brightness of the images, it works best for reducing the brightness when
you are in a dark room.

Furthermore, this application also has a feature to download mangas from the mangaclash website.
The downloading is still a bit buggy, but will improve over time

Please check the TODO if you wish to contribute

## TODO
- [x] Convert the project to use vue and typescript
- [ ] Be able to close the sidebar in the viewer
- [ ] Be able to view the mangas on the phone -> make it available on local network
- [ ] Alert the client when a manga has finished downloading
- [ ] Fix bugs in the downloader
- [ ] Fix the project structure for the server, everything is in a single file at the moment
- [ ] Dockerise the project for easier setup, but this might mess up the downloading feature???
