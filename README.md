## Note

This project doesn't support downloading manga. It is primarily designed for reading manga that you
have already downloaded. I have manga downloading projects however, they haven't been maintained for a while.

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. Install Node.js, Yarn, and ensure the `make` command is available.
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishi-Bidani/mangaviewer.git
```

3. Update the settings.json file in ./server/data to point to your manga folder.

```json
{
    "BASE_MANGA_FOLDER": ["D:\\", "manga"], // The base folder where your manga is stored. The app will look for the manga in this folder.
    "IGNORE_LIST": ["kenja no mago"] // The list of (sub)folders to ignore.
}
```

4. `make build-exec` will run everything but maken sure to update `GLOBAL_EXECUTABLE_FOLDER` in the makefile.

## TODO

-   [ ] Add persistent bookmarks
-   [ ] Sync with MAL
